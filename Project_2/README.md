# Zuber Database

## Overview
* The project task was to analyze data and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency to understand passenger preferences using SQL.

## Accomplishments
* Identified key ride-sharing patterns and passenger preferences for Zuber's Chicago launch by conducting exploratory data analysis using SQL and segmenting ride frequency by company and date range.
* Uncovered company-specific trends in ride data by grouping and summarizing rides for Yellow and Blue taxi companies during a specific time period.
* Provided insights into external factors impacting ride frequency by conducting hypothesis testing and data cleaning using SQL CASE statements to classify weather conditions.
* Analyzed ride duration and weather conditions by extracting, joining, and aggregating relevant data from multiple tables, offering insights into factors affecting ride frequency.
